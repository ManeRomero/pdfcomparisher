A simple file update form to overlap different images to compare

The objective in here is to develope a tool to help on one of my job challenges: compare pdf files and stablish differences between it.
I'll try to make a simple interface with some options. The real deal is to get a dynamic overlapping file system... ain't gonna be easy!
